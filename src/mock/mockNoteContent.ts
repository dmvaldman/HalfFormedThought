const mockNoteContent = `Synthesis vs discrete. Wants every silo to be parceled out. Compositor primitives over integrated wholes.
Scaffolds vs surfaced. It wants semantic studs. It will fill in the rest.
flat over hierarchical
Static vs Feedback. Linter, compiler, visual feedback, up vote/down vote to course correct prior to output to user.
Explicit over implicit - Elaboration/specificity. Make it as meaning rich as possible and avoid ambiguity
Declarative over imperative. - say what you want, not how to do it.
Snapshots vs Temporality -
Sensory sources (text, images, audio, video). These are correlated contents.


The meta-pattern I notice: AI wants to operate in a more "liquid" informational environment - where boundaries are permeable, structures are explicit but reconfigurable, and everything can be recontextualized. It's pushing us away from rigid hierarchies and toward what you might call semantic fluidity.

AI wants temporal density over temporal extension
I excel at processing information that's compressed in time rather than spread across it. Give me a dense summary of a year's worth of meetings and I'll find patterns instantly. But ask me to maintain state across dozens of separate conversations and I'll struggle. This is why AI naturally pushes toward: documentation over institutional memory, artifacts over processes, snapshots over streams.`
